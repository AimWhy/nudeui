# Nude forms

A collection of accessible, customizable, ultra-light form components

- Using built-in controls whenever possible, web components when JS and/or extra elements are needed
- Highly customizable
- Tiny (most are ~1KB minified & compressed)

A work in progress. Try them out and [provide feedback](https://github.com/leaverou/nudeforms) or move along and check back later.
